## Introduction
Robot Operating System (ROS or ros) is an open-source robotics middleware suite. Although ROS is not an operating system (OS) but a set of software frameworks for robot software development , the versions of :
1.	ROS 1
2.	ROS 2
3.	ROS-Industrial


Operating Systems ROS runs only on Unix servers. While ROS includes software for Ubuntu, Mac OS X, and Fedora, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and other Linux platforms


If you are working on Ubuntu, it doesnâ€™t matter. But what for Windows people? Here we go!


To install software, you may have to satisfy the system requirements. To install ROS in windows, you need the following system requirements.


You must have a Windows 10 64-bit device


Also, it is recommended that you have at least 20GB of free space on your C:\ drive for installation and development.


 * You need virtualbox to use Ubuntu and  develop ROS projects for Windows. 
 
 ## Algorithm
 
 to downloud ROS 1 we need :
 
 1- install virtualbox 
 
 2- install Ubunto in virtualbox
 
 3- install ROS1 in Ubunto
 
   following the steps :
   
  ### 1- install virtualbox 
  
  1- download virtualbox (VirtualBox 6.1.34 )platform packages [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
  
  2- choose windows hosts 
  
  3- open file and setup the program 
  
  4- you don't need to change any options just next>next>next>finish
  
  5- open the Oracle VM VirtualBox
